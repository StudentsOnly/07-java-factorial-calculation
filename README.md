## Exercise: Factorial Calculation

### Objective:

- Write a Java program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer n. 
- The program should prompt the user to enter the value of n, and then compute and display the factorial.

### Instructions:

1. Ask the user to enter the value of n.
2. Initialize a variable factorial to store the factorial value, initially set to 1.
3. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n.
4. Multiply the current value of factorial by the loop variable.
5. After the loop finishes, display the computed factorial.
